# ChatControl supports dynamic, high performance variables you create! They can be used across
# the plugin, for example in formatting your chat or death messages. Currently, the folder
# variables/ stores all custom variables in each separate yml file.
#
# Variables can not only be used to display information, but because you can write your own full
# code in JavaScript to display them, they can also do whatever you would wish for your
# players/server, such as sneaking in code to send sounds or spawn monsters.
#
# Coding this variable requires a little bit of JavaScript knowledge, see the link below.
#
# For documentation and help, please see this link:

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Where should this variable be used?
#
# FORMAT = used in your formats with {syntax}, players cannot use it
# MESSAGE = players can use it with [syntax] in their chat messages
Type: FORMAT

# The key you can later use in formats. Do not use brackets. 
# Put the variable name here such as my_variable and you'll be able to call it with {my_variable}.
Key: ""

# The value the key will be replaced to. This uses JavaScript, you can use 
# "player" to get the player, if available.
#
# TIP: Enable Performance.Support_Variables_In_Variables in settings.yml to support variables here.
Value: ""

# What JavaScript condition must return true for this variable to show?
# You can put variables in here to get replaced.
Sender_Condition: ""

# What permission must the message sender have in order for this variable to display to him?
