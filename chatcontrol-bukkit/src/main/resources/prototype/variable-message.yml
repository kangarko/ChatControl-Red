# ChatControl supports dynamic, high performance variables you create! They can be used across
# the plugin, for example in formatting your chat or death messages. Currently, the folder
# variables/ stores all custom variables in each separate yml file.
#
# Variables can not only be used to display information, but because you can write your own full
# code in JavaScript to display them, they can also do whatever you would wish for your
# players/server, such as sneaking in code to send sounds or spawn monsters.
#
# Coding this variable requires a little bit of JavaScript knowledge, see the link below.
#
# For documentation and help, please see this link:
