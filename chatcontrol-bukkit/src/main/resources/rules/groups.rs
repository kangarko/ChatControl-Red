# This file stores groups. Groups are simply operators you can reuse multiple times in rules,
# so that you can apply the same blocking strategy to 100s of swear words without copy-pasting
# the operators into each rule.
#
# Groups support all operators you would typically use on rules except:
# ignore type
#
# For help, see https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl/wiki/Rules
