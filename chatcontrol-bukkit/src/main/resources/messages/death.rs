# Death messages. Uses the same syntax as files in rules/ folder but operators
# are slightly different. For documentation and a quick tutorial, see:
# https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl/wiki/messages
#
# Rules in this file are read from top to bottom. Set 'Stop_On_First_Match' 
# key in settings.yml only send the first message we can, to the player (based on
# operator conditions).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# They are read like a newspaper and each player only sees one message,
# that is the first one we can send to him.

# An example of not sending any message when a player kills an NPC player
group citizens-npc
require npc

# An example of not sending any message when player dies having creative gamemode
group silent_on_creative
require sender gamemode CREATIVE
then abort

# Require the player to by killed by a trident.
#group playerTrident
#require projectile trident
#require killer player
#message:
#- {killer} has thrown {killer_item} at {player}

# Require the player to be killed by himself throwing an enderpearl.
group enderPearl
require self
require cause fall
require projectile ender_pearl

# Support MythicMobs or Boss plugin and send a special death message.
