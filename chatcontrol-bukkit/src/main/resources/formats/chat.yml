#
#   A format renders and customizes a message send to player(s). It can be used across our plugin 
#   in many places, such as in channels, rules, commands etc.
#
#   Remember, you can remove or edit all parts below, and create your own ones! A lot options
#   are optional, that means you do not have to specify them at all.
#
#   Each format consists of parts such as "delete-chat" below. Each part can show different hover
#   events etc. or be hidden if sender/recipient has a certain permission, and more.
#
#   All format options except "Message" are optional. If you don't need those, you can remove it.
#
#   Options for each format part:
#   - Message: A simple string what will be shown in the chat. 
#   - Sender_Permission: What permission must the message sender have for this part to show.
#   - Receiver_Permission: Only show this part to the receivers having this permission.
#   - Sender_Condition: JavaScript condition that must return true for sender (use "player" to get
#                       the Player instance from Spigot) for this part to show.
#   - Receiver_Condition: Similar to Sender_Condition but the script will evaluate against each 
#                         receiver and only show this part to those for which condition is true.
#   - Hover: One line or a list of tooltip to show when hovering over this part with your mouse.
#   - Hover_Item: JavaScript with "player" instance as variable that must return a valid ItemStack
#                 to show when hovering over this part (e.g. "player.getItemInHand()")

  # Show the [X] button only visible to people having permission on 'Receiver_Permission'
  # that enables you to remove chat messages by clicking on them!
  # PS: They are still saved to log and can be viewed with "/chc log".
  # TIP: Give yourself chatcontrol.bypass.spamkick to prevent being kicked when removing mass messages.
  delete-chat: 
    Message: "<dark_gray>[<dark_red>X<dark_gray>] <white>"
    Hover: "<red>Remove this message from chat for all players."

  # Show the [VIP] prefix if sender, not receiver like above, has the

    Message: "<dark_gray>[<gold>VIP<dark_gray>] "
    Sender_Permission: chatcontrol.group.vip
  
  # Show the [Read] prefix if the receiver is only reading this channel.

    Message: '<dark_gray>[<aqua>Read<dark_gray>] '
    Receiver_Variable: "{player_channel_mode_{channel}} read"
  
  # Show the [Discord] prefix if the sender is from Discord (we use our own
  # special variable for this) and add some interactive elements.
  discord-prefix: 
    Message: "<dark_gray>[<blue>Discord<dark_gray>] <white>"

  # Finally, pull the regular player prefix from your permissions plugin using Vault.
  # If you encounter issues, you can try to use placeholders from another plugin, such as {luckperms_prefix}.
  # The + at the end of the variable automatically inserts a space if player has prefix.
  # E.g. "admin" turns into "admin ". If there's no prefix, you won't end with a trailing space.

      - '<gray>{player_prefix+}{player_name} {player_suffix}'
      # The ping variable accesses NMS on older Minecraft versions and poses a significat performance penalty.

      - '<gray>Rank<dark_gray>: <white>{player_group}'
      # You can also use PlaceholderAPI variables here

  # Another way to send a prefix based on the output of a placeholder.
  # This is useful if you don't want to define rank prefixes using your permission plugin.
  # The part below will only be send if the output of the {luckperms_primary_group_name} placeholder is "owner".
  # (Case sensitive - You can check for booleans or for a String value)
  #alternative-prefix:
  #  Message: '<red>[<white>Owner<red>] '
  #  # WRONG USE: While the line below will work, it will be significantly slower than if you configure the prefix
  #  # in LuckPerms via /lp group owner meta setprefix "&c[&fOwner&c] " and place {player_prefix+} in the part below.
  #  Sender_Variable: "{luckperms_primary_group_name} owner"

  # Display a typical player name to players with the given permission. change {player_name} 
  # to {player_nick} to show nick instead. We'll revert to show normal name if player has no nick.
  # To display a name in rainbow colors, uncomment "Gradient". This requires MC 1.16+
  player-name: 
    Message: "{player_nick}<reset>"
    #Message: "{player_name}"
    #Gradient: RED - YELLOW
    Hover: "<gray>Click to message."
    Suggest_Command: "/tell {player_name} "

  # And finally, show the message the player has typed out, prepending it with player's
  # suffix from your permission plugin. We replace {player_chat_color} and {player_chat_decoration} with the 
  # color and decoration set in '/chc color'.
  message: 
    Message: "<gray>: {player_suffix}{player_chat_color}{player_chat_decoration}{message}"
